## Scope

Luxero Climate runs entirely locally within your Home Assistant instance. It does not connect to any external servers or cloud services. The main security considerations are:

- **WebSocket API** — All endpoints are authenticated through Home Assistant's built-in auth system
- **Store data** — Room configurations and thermal data are stored in HA's `.storage` directory with standard HA file permissions
- **No external dependencies** — The integration has zero Python dependencies beyond Home Assistant itself
